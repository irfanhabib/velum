h1 Bootstrap your Container as a Service Platform

p
  | In order to complete the installation, it is necessary to bootstrap a few additional nodes, those will be the Kubernetes Master and Workers.
  |  This process leverages AutoYaST and is (almost) fully automated.
  |  In case you are not familiar with it, you can find more information about AutoYaST in the&nbsp;
  a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html" official documentation.
  |  The automatic installation gets invoked by adding <strong>autoyast=#{autoyast_url host: @controller_node, port: ENV["VELUM_PORT"]}</strong> to the kernel parameter list.
  |  If you aren't under a PXE environment you can also use <strong>netsetup=dhcp</strong> kernel parameter for the network to be automatically configured using a reachable DHCP server.
  |  As installation media, you can use the very same image you bootstrapped the admin node with.

  |  A ready to use AutoYaST profile has already been generated for you during the bootstrap of the admin node.
  |  Bootstrap all the nodes you want to make part of this platform by adding the following boot parameter
  |  <strong>autoyast=#{autoyast_url host: @controller_node, port: ENV["VELUM_PORT"]}</strong>

h2 Tips
p
  | You don't need to boot each node by hand. More information on how to embed an AutoYaST profile in your PXE environment is available&nbsp;
  a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#bootmedium.pxe" here
  | . Where <strong>#{autoyast_url host: @controller_node, port: ENV["VELUM_PORT"]}</strong> is the real, generated path to the AutoYaST profile served by the dashboard.
